#this is a todo/wish/feature-request/outlook list for the openEMS project
#priorities: todo (highest) --> outlook (lowest)

todo / mandatory for v0.1.0:
- more examples and lots of testing...
- pml
- dump fields only on box surfaces
- dump fields at certain timesteps/frequencies
- field visualization (matlab)
- nf2ff calc & visualization (matlab)

wishes:
- location dependend excitation given by a file (e.g. simulated with comsol or complicated formula via matlab)
- dispersive material
- optimized operator/engine
- multithreaded processing (should be easy enough)
- more output file-formats (e.g. hdf5)

feature-requests:
- port libraries

outlook:
- incorporate a static FD-solver into openEMS
- include other EM-solver (e.g. FEM, FDFD, TLM)
