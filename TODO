#this is a todo/wish/feature-request/outlook list for the openEMS project
#priorities: todo (highest) --> outlook (lowest)

todo:
- pml
- more examples and lots of testing...
- location dependend excitation given by a file (e.g. simulated with comsol or complicated formula via matlab)
- (re)include cylindrical FDTD

wishes:
- dispersive material
- optimized operator/engine
- multithreaded processing (should be easy enough)
- more output file-formats (e.g. hdf5)

feature-requests:
- port libraries

outlook:
- incorporate a static FD-solver into openEMS
- include other EM-solver (e.g. FEM)
